# Guess The Age: Age Estimation From Facial Images

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Guess The Age (GTA) contest, an international competition focusing on age estimation from facial images. This project leverages state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to address the challenge of accurately estimating the age of individuals based on facial features.

### Dataset: Mivia Age Dataset

To empower participants in training effective models, we provide the Mivia Age Dataset. This dataset boasts 575,073 facial images annotated with age labels, making it one of the largest publicly available face datasets globally with age annotations. The competition evaluates proposed methods on a test set comprising over 150,000 images, ensuring robust assessment metrics and generalization to new data.

### Problem Statement

Age estimation from facial images has become a crucial task in various real-world applications, including digital signage, social robotics, and business intelligence. In the era of deep learning, numerous DCNNs for age estimation have been introduced, achieving performance comparable to human accuracy.

### Challenges and Focus

Many state-of-the-art methods rely on complex ensembles of DCNNs, leading to classifiers that may be impractical for real-world applications due to prohibitive computational requirements. Moreover, their training procedures are often intricate, demanding extensive and challenging-to-collect training sets.

In response to these challenges, this contest encourages methods based on a single neural network or small ensembles consisting of, at most, three classifiers. The competition aims to explore effective solutions that balance accuracy, efficiency, and practicality for real-world deployment.
